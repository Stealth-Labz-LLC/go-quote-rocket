## Scalability

### Time to Add New Components

| Component | Traditional | AI-Assisted |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| New vertical | 2-3 days | 30 minutes |

| New lead buyer | 1 day | 1 hour |
| New brand/white-label | 1 day | 30 minutes |
| Bug fix | Hours | Minutes |
| New feature | Days-weeks | Hours-days |

### Portfolio Potential

```
If you can build 1 platform in 17 days...

1 month  = 2 platforms    →  Revenue potential: 2x
3 months = 5 platforms    →  Revenue potential: 5x
1 year   = 20 platforms   →  Revenue potential: 20x

Each platform: $12K-$100K+ monthly revenue potential
Portfolio value compounds with each addition
