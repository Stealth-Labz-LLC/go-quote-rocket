                <p>Running a small business means managing risk. One lawsuit, fire, or cyberattack can wipe out years of work. The right insurance protects what you've built without breaking your budget. Here's what coverage you actually need and what you can probably skip.</p>

                <h2>General Liability Insurance</h2>
                <p>This is the foundation of business insurance. General liability protects against claims of bodily injury, property damage, and advertising injury arising from your business operations. A customer slips in your store, your product damages someone's property, or you're accused of libel in your advertising—general liability responds.</p>
                <p>Coverage limits typically range from $1 million per occurrence to $2 million aggregate. Premiums for low-risk businesses start around $400-600 annually, with higher rates for businesses with more exposure. Many leases and contracts require proof of general liability coverage, making it effectively mandatory for most businesses.</p>
                <p>Don't confuse general liability with coverage for professional mistakes or employee injuries—those require separate policies. Think of general liability as protection against accidents and incidents that affect third parties.</p>

                <h2>Professional Liability Insurance</h2>
                <p>Also called errors and omissions (E&O) insurance, professional liability covers claims arising from your professional services. If a client claims your advice, work, or services caused them financial harm, this policy provides defense and pays covered damages.</p>
                <p>This coverage is essential for consultants, accountants, attorneys, healthcare providers, real estate agents, technology companies, and other service professionals. A single malpractice or negligence claim can cost more to defend than you've earned in years.</p>
                <p>Premiums vary dramatically based on profession and risk level. A marketing consultant might pay $500-1,000 annually, while a medical professional could pay many thousands. The coverage is specific to your profession, so work with an agent who understands your field.</p>

                <h2>Commercial Property Insurance</h2>
                <p>If you own or lease space and have physical assets—equipment, inventory, furniture—commercial property insurance protects against loss from fire, theft, weather, and other covered perils. Whether you own the building or rent space, you need coverage for your business property.</p>
                <p>Property policies can be basic or comprehensive. Basic policies cover named perils only—specific events listed in the policy. Comprehensive policies cover all perils except those specifically excluded, providing broader protection.</p>
                <p>Don't underestimate the value of your business property. Add up equipment, inventory, furniture, computers, and improvements you've made to your space. Most businesses have more at risk than they initially estimate.</p>

                <h2>Business Interruption Insurance</h2>
                <p>What happens if a covered event forces you to close temporarily? Business interruption insurance covers lost income and ongoing expenses while you're unable to operate. This coverage typically attaches to your property policy and activates when a covered property claim forces closure.</p>
                <p>Many businesses discovered the value of this coverage during the pandemic, though most policies exclude viruses. For traditional property losses like fire or major storm damage, business interruption coverage can literally keep your business alive during rebuilding.</p>
                <p>Consider your fixed expenses—rent, utilities, loan payments, payroll for key employees—and how long you could sustain them without revenue. That's your starting point for coverage limits.</p>

                <h2>Workers Compensation Insurance</h2>
                <p>If you have employees, workers compensation is legally required in almost every state. This coverage pays medical expenses and partial lost wages for employees injured on the job, while protecting your business from lawsuits over workplace injuries.</p>
                <p>Premiums are based on your payroll and the risk level of your industry. Office workers cost less to insure than construction workers. Even low-risk businesses should expect to pay 1-3% of payroll. Higher-risk industries pay significantly more.</p>
                <p>Don't try to avoid workers comp by calling employees independent contractors if they're really employees. Misclassification carries severe penalties, and you'll have zero protection if a worker is injured.</p>

                <h2>Cyber Liability Insurance</h2>
                <p>Digital threats are now a top concern for businesses of all sizes. Cyber liability insurance covers expenses from data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other cyber incidents. This includes notification costs, credit monitoring for affected parties, forensic investigations, legal defense, and regulatory fines.</p>
                <p>Any business that stores customer data, processes payments, or relies on digital systems should consider this coverage. Small businesses are frequent targets precisely because they often lack robust security measures.</p>
                <p>Premiums depend on your data exposure and revenue, starting around $500-1,000 annually for small operations. As cyber threats increase, this coverage has become as fundamental as general liability for many businesses.</p>

                <h2>Commercial Auto Insurance</h2>
                <p>If your business owns vehicles or employees drive for business purposes, you need commercial auto insurance. Personal auto policies typically exclude business use, leaving you exposed when making deliveries, visiting clients, or running business errands.</p>
                <p>Owned vehicle coverage is straightforward—insure the vehicles titled to your business. Hired and non-owned auto coverage protects when employees drive rental cars or personal vehicles for business. The latter is often overlooked but important.</p>

                <h2>What You Can Skip (Maybe)</h2>
                <p>Not every business needs every coverage type. Product liability matters if you manufacture or sell physical products but is less relevant for service businesses. Umbrella coverage provides extra liability limits above your other policies—valuable for businesses with significant exposure but potentially overkill for small, low-risk operations.</p>
                <p>Directors and officers (D&O) insurance protects leadership from personal liability for business decisions. It's essential for companies with outside investors or boards but optional for sole proprietors making their own decisions.</p>

                <h2>Putting It Together</h2>
                <p>Most small businesses should start with general liability and property coverage, often bundled as a Business Owner's Policy (BOP) at a discount. Add workers comp if you have employees, professional liability if you provide services, and commercial auto if vehicles are involved.</p>
                <p>Work with an agent who specializes in small business insurance. Explain your operations thoroughly so they can identify your actual risks rather than selling you a standard package. Insurance needs evolve as your business grows, so review coverage annually.</p>
