                    <p>Navigating health coverage in America can feel overwhelming. Between employer plans, marketplace options, and government programs like Medicare, knowing which path to take requires understanding what each option actually provides. Here's a clear breakdown of how these systems work and which might be right for your situation.</p>

                    <h2>What Is Private Health Insurance?</h2>
                    <p>Private health insurance comes from non-government sources. This includes employer-sponsored plans, individual policies purchased through the ACA marketplace, and plans bought directly from insurance companies. These plans vary widely in cost, coverage, and provider networks.</p>
                    <p>Employer-sponsored insurance remains the most common form of coverage for working Americans. Your employer typically pays a portion of the premium, making it more affordable than buying individual coverage. The trade-off is that you're limited to the plans your employer offers.</p>
                    <p>Individual marketplace plans provide coverage for those without employer options. Depending on your income, you may qualify for subsidies that reduce your monthly premium and out-of-pocket costs. These plans must cover essential health benefits and can't deny you coverage for pre-existing conditions.</p>

                    <h2>What Is Medicare?</h2>
                    <p>Medicare is federal health insurance primarily for people 65 and older, though it also covers some younger individuals with disabilities or specific conditions. It's funded through payroll taxes, premiums, and general federal revenue.</p>
                    <p>Medicare has four main parts. Part A covers hospital stays, skilled nursing care, hospice, and some home health services. Most people don't pay a premium for Part A if they or their spouse paid Medicare taxes while working. Part B covers doctor visits, outpatient care, preventive services, and medical equipment, with a monthly premium that varies by income.</p>
                    <p>Part C, also called Medicare Advantage, is an alternative way to receive Medicare benefits through private insurance companies. These plans often include extra benefits like dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage. Part D provides prescription drug coverage and is offered through private insurers approved by Medicare.</p>

                    <h2>Key Differences in Coverage</h2>
                    <p>Private insurance and Medicare differ significantly in how they structure coverage. Private plans typically use networks of doctors and hospitals. Going out-of-network means paying more or having claims denied entirely. Medicare generally allows you to see any provider who accepts Medicare, giving you more flexibility in choosing doctors.</p>
                    <p>Cost structures also differ. Private plans use deductibles, copays, and coinsurance, with an out-of-pocket maximum that caps your annual spending. Once you hit that cap, the plan pays 100%. Original Medicare has no out-of-pocket maximum, which is why many beneficiaries add supplemental coverage called Medigap policies.</p>
                    <p>Prescription drug coverage works differently too. Private plans include pharmacy benefits in the overall plan. With Original Medicare, you need to enroll in a separate Part D plan for drug coverage, adding complexity but also choice.</p>

                    <h2>When Can You Enroll?</h2>
                    <p>Timing matters with both types of coverage. For private insurance, the main enrollment window is during open enrollment, typically November through mid-January for marketplace plans. You can enroll outside this window only if you experience a qualifying life event like losing other coverage, getting married, or having a child.</p>
                    <p>Medicare has its own enrollment periods. Your Initial Enrollment Period is a seven-month window around your 65th birthday. Missing this window can result in permanent late enrollment penalties. General Enrollment runs from January through March, with coverage starting in July. Medicare Advantage and Part D have an annual enrollment period from October through early December.</p>

                    <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
                    <p>What you'll pay depends heavily on your specific situation. Private insurance premiums vary based on your age, location, tobacco use, and plan level. A healthy 40-year-old might pay a few hundred dollars monthly, while a 60-year-old in a high-cost area could pay over a thousand.</p>
                    <p>Medicare Part B premium for 2025 is around $185 per month for most people, with higher earners paying more. Add Part D for drug coverage and potentially a Medigap policy for supplemental coverage, and total monthly costs can range from $200 to $500 or more.</p>

                    <h2>Which Is Right for You?</h2>
                    <p>If you're under 65 and working, employer coverage is usually your best bet. The employer contribution makes it hard to beat, and group plans often provide solid coverage at reasonable costs.</p>
                    <p>If you're self-employed or between jobs, marketplace plans with subsidies can be affordable depending on your income. Always check what you qualify for before assuming you can't afford coverage.</p>
                    <p>Once you're 65, Medicare becomes your primary option in most cases. Even if you're still working, you'll want to understand how Medicare coordinates with employer coverage. Many people keep employer coverage as primary if still working, then transition fully to Medicare upon retirement.</p>

                    <h2>Making the Transition</h2>
                    <p>Moving from private insurance to Medicare requires planning. Enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period to avoid penalties. Understand that Medicare doesn't cover everything—you'll likely want supplemental coverage. Review your prescription medications to ensure any Part D plan you choose covers them affordably.</p>
                    <p>Don't assume Medicare will work exactly like your old insurance. The rules are different, the costs are structured differently, and the provider access may change. Take time to understand the system before you need to use it.</p>
